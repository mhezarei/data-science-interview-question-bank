# data-science-interview-question-bank
This repository contains technical questions asked in data science interviews. Most of them are asked in interviews of Iran's big companies, but other famous questions found on the internet are also included.

After you find yourself ready to take an interview, reviewing these questions could be a great help. Since most of these questions are gathered from people's experience, it's recommended to answer them as if they were asked in the interview, e.g., answering with loud sound (not mumbling), giving the best possible answer, etc.

**Note that** most of the answers are given in the interview, so they might not be entirely accurate. You are encouraged to think about the questions and find the solution that you believe is the best.

## How to contribute?

### Adding a question:
If you've taken an interview and would like to add questions here, please append your question to the end of the list using the following format with the correct question number and **beware that** your kind support is enormously appreciated :).

```
#### <182>. <How old are you?>
- **Added by**: (Optional) <John Abbasi> (you could also link you github account)
- **Interviewee**: (Optional) <John Abbasi> (you could also link you github account)
- **Interviewer Company**: (Optional) <Tesla>

```

The sections wrapped in `<>` should be changed by the author, and other parts **should** remain the same. **Please** preview your README.md file to make sure your question doesn't break the style.

Alternatively, you could write your question(s) as issues (with more freedom in writing style), and I will add them to the list in the above format.

- If you think the answer to a question is entirely wrong, try to submit a new issue.
- If you think the answer to a question is missing something, try to add that missing part to that answer.
- Otherwise, you try the following way:
  - Submit a new issue regarding your problem.
  - Email me at <mzarei137@gmail.com>.

I would appreciate any other form of contribution you can provide.
