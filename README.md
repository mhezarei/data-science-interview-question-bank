# data-science-interview-question-bank
This repository contains questions asked in data science interviews. Most of them are asked in interviews of Iran's big companies, but other famous questions found on the internet are also included.

After you find yourself ready to take an interview, reviewing these questions could be a great help. Since most of these questions are gathered from people's experience, it's recommended to answer them as if they were asked in the interview, e.g., answering with loud sound (not mumbling), giving the best possible answer, etc.
