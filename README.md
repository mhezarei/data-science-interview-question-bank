# data-science-interview-question-bank
This repository contains questions asked in data science interviews. Most of them are asked in interviews of Iran's big companies, but other famous questions found on the internet are also included.

After you find yourself ready to take an interview, reviewing these questions could be a great help. Since most of these questions are gathered from people's experience, it's recommended to answer them as if they were asked in the interview, e.g., answering with loud sound (not mumbling), giving the best possible answer, etc.

**Note that** most of the answers are ones given in the interview, so they might not be completely true. You are encouraged to think about the questions and find the answer that you think is the best.

## How to contribute?

### Adding a question:
If you've taken an interview and would like to add questions here, please append your question to the end of the list using the following format with the correct question number and **beware that** your kind support is enormously appreciated :).

```

```

The sections wrapped in `<>` should be changed by the author and other parts **should** remain the same.

Alternatively, you could write your question(s) as issues (with more freedom in writing style) and I will add them to the list in the above format.

- If you think the answer to a question is completely wrong, try to submit a new issue.
- If you think the answer to a question is missing something, try to add that missing part to that answer.
- Otherwise, you try the following way:
  - Submit a new issue regarding your problem.
  - Email me at <mzarei137@gmail.com>.
